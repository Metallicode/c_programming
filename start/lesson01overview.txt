- machines

A mechanically, electrically, or electronically operated device for performing a task (A piece of work).
An assemblage of parts that transmit forces, motion, and energy one to another in a predetermined manner.




- automata / Finite State Machine (FSM).

"self-acting"

device which follows a predetermined sequence of operations (algorithm) automatically.

(Q, ∑, δ, q0, F)


- turing machines

machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape (divided into discrete "cells") according to a table of rules.
A Turing machine is a general example of a central processing unit (CPU).
nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.



- language.

a systematic means of communicating ideas or feelings by the use of conventionalized signs, sounds, gestures, or marks having understood meanings.

formal language consists of words whose letters are taken from an alphabet and are well-formed according to a specific set of rules.



- code (encode, decode)
